# image-cartoonifier
Turning real-world images to animated ones. The basic idea is to fill flat parts with some color, then draw thick lines on the edges, so Ithe flat areas become much flatter and the edges become much more distinct. By doing edge detection and smoothing effect on flat areas, then drawing enhanced edges back on top to generate a cartoon effect.
